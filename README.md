# PhD Thesis Template
The LaTeX template I used for my PhD Thesis/Dissertation submitted to the University of Potsdam.
This is a two-column, single-spaced template. (Of course that can be changed in the preamble...)

This is an edited version of an edited version of an edited version of a colleague's thesis. Original template used for basis not mine.
